## Hi, I'm Kaio Mota

- 👀 I’m interested in web development. I've been currently using React as my front-end framework and Node.js to perform the back-end.
- 🌱 I’m studying Computer Engineering.
- 👨‍🏫 I'm an English teacher and started my career transition into technology in 2021.
- 🤝 I’m looking foward to collaborating on projects related to back-end and front-end, but I would appreciate helping in any other project where my abilities come in handy.
- ⚡ I'm curious about AI
- 📚 Fyodor Dostoevsky
