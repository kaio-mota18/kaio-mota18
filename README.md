- 👋 Hi, I’m Kaio Mota.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development. I've been currently using React as my front-end framework and Node.js to perform the back-end.
- 🌱 I’m studying Computer Engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to back-end and front-end, but I would appreciate helping in any other project where my abilities come in handy.
